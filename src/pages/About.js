    <p className="mb-4">
      The Hybrid AI Chatbot is a futuristic conversational assistant developed by Omkar Bidave using a dual-mode
      approach: online via Google Gemini and offline fallback using Ollama. This project demonstrates resilience,
      innovation, and real-world problem solving in network-constrained environments.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4">
      The bot features a dynamic chat interface, dark/light theme support, secure authentication, and intelligent
      session management. It is designed for scalable deployment and showcases advanced frontend-backend integration
      with fallback logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project is part of Omkar's journey toward building intelligent systems that are accessible and reliable in
      both connected and offline scenarios, aligning with industry expectations for 15â€“20 LPA software roles.
